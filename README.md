Stealing just the xone and xpad-noone ebuilds from the deprecated [src\_prepare-overlay](https://gitlab.com/src_prepare/src_prepare-overlay)

Right now I don't need any bugfixes or new kernel support, but if I upgrade the xone ebuild I'll have to switch to the better-maintained [dlundqvist fork](https://github.com/dlundqvist/xone/)
