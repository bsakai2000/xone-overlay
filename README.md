Stealing just the [xone](https://github.com/medusalix/xone) and [xpad-noone](https://github.com/medusalix/xpad-noone) ebuilds from the deprecated [src\_prepare-overlay](https://gitlab.com/src_prepare/src_prepare-overlay)

Note that version `xone-0.3_p20250314.ebuild` switches from the original xone to the better-maintained [dlundqvist fork](https://github.com/dlundqvist/xone/), to support 6.11+ kernels
